    You ain't seen nothing yet! Jelly baby? We are always in trouble! Isn't it extraordinary—it follows us everywhere. Yes, that's right, you're going. You've been gone for ages. You're already gone. You're still here. You've just arrived. I haven't even met you yet. It all depends on who you are and how you look at it. Strange business, time. The Doctor. Nosey parker. My ship…my TARDIS… Powerful! Crush the lesser races! Conquer the galaxy! UNIMAGINABLE POWER! UNLIMITED RICE PUDDING! Et cetera! Et cetera!

    Exotic alien swords are easy to come by, Aces are rare. Only the madman can see the way clearly through the tangled forest. You see when I started, all those years ago, I was just running. I called myself the Doctor but it was just a name. Then I went to Skaro. And I met you lot. And I understood who I was. Let's go in! Yes, that's right, you're going. You've been gone for ages. You're already gone. You're still here. You've just arrived. I haven't even met you yet. It all depends on who you are and how you look at it. Strange business, time. </p>

    Every great decision creates ripples. Like a huge boulder dropping in a lake. The ripples merge and rebound off the banks in unforseeable ways. The heavier the decision, the larger the waves, the more uncertain the consequences. It all started out as a mild curiosity in the junkyard, and now it's turned out to be quite a great spirit of adventure. Goodbye... Fancypants! You need to get yourself a better dictionary. When you do, look up 'genocide'. You'll find a little picture of me there, and the caption'll read 'Over my dead body'.

    This thing is smaller on the inside than it is on the outside. You may be a doctor. But I'm the Doctor. The definite article, you might say. Have a jelly baby. Not allowed? Not allowed? Me, I’m allowed everywhere. Brave heart, Clara. Sweet, maybe... Passionate, I suppose... But don't ever mistake that for nice. I've lived for over 2000 years and not all of them have been good. I'd call you a genius, except I'm in the room. You know Jo, I sometimes think that military intelligence is a contradiction in terms.

    Have a jelly baby. I am totally against bantering. I've reversed the polarity of the Neutron flow, so the TARDIS should be free from the force field now. Rest is for the weary, sleep is for the dead. I feel like a hungry man eager for the feast! I hate computers and refuse to be bullied by them. Hello-o-o-o. Anybody remotely interesting is mad in some way. Are you capable of speaking without flapping your hands about? Our lives are important—at least to us—as we see, so we learn…Our destiny is in the stars , so let's go and search for it.

    Jo, did you fail Latin as well as science? Please tell me I didn't get old. Anything but old. I was young! Oh... is he grey? Are you listening to me? Excellent. Blow up that vehicle. We are always in trouble! Isn't it extraordinary—it follows us everywhere. Shut up, K-9! Be a pal and tell me, Am I a good man? I don't think that I'm a hugging person now. Shut up! Just shut up, shut up, shut up, shuttity up up up! Why can't you leave me alone?! You've had this place redecorated, haven't you? Hmm, don't like it.

    You cannot rewrite history! Not one line! And in that battle there was a man with more blood on his hands than any other. A man who would commit a crime that would silence the universe. And that man was me. Shut up, K-9! People assume that time is a strict progression of cause-and-effect... but actually, from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly... timey-wimey... stuff. You’ll never understand. I want to see the universe, not to rule it. Don't be sad Grace. You'll do great things.

    I hate computers and refuse to be bullied by them. You were expecting someone else? Your species has the most amazing capacity for self-deception, matched only by its ingenuity when trying to destroy itself. We are not of this race. We are not of this earth. Susan and I are wanderers in the fourth dimension of time and space. Right! So stop dilly-dallying, and cross it! Well, of course I'm being childish! There's no point being grown-up if you can't be childish sometimes. You look beautiful! ...considering. That you're human.

    I just have one question… do you know how to fly this thing? Nice to meet you, Rose. You realise one of us is lying about our basic programming. And I think we both know which one that is. The universe hangs by such a delicate thread of coincidences that it would be useless to meddle with it, unless like me you're a Time Lord. It was on the planet Skaro that my old enemy the Master was finally put on trial. They say he listened calmly as his list of evil crimes was read... and sentence passed. Then he made his last and I thought somewhat curious request. He demanded that I, the Doctor, a rival Timelord, should take his remains back to our home planet, Gallifrey.

    Sweet, maybe... Passionate, I suppose... But don't ever mistake that for nice. Hello-o-o-o. Overconfidence, this, and a small screwdriver. I’m absolutely sorted. I just have one question… do you know how to fly this thing? Well, who are you boys? Oh, of course! Are you his companions? Do try and keep out of my way in future and in past, there's a good fellow. The time continuum should be big enough for the both of us. When I say run, run. ...RUN! The trouble with computers, of course, is that they're very sophisticated idiots. They do exactly what you tell them at amazing speed. Even if you order them to kill you. So if you do happen to change your mind, it's very difficult to stop them from obeying the original order. But not impossible.
